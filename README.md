I am a Software Engineer seeking full time employment who really enjoys the nitty gritty work of tweaking the code and putting building blocks together to find solutions. In my own time, I have worked on projects for accessibility and fun, specifically making shortcuts for things that were previously possible but very tedious. I want to bring my passion for problem solving to help make systems easier to use, more intuitive, and more accessible for end users.
